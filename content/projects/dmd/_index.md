DMD - Distance Measuring Device
----------------------------
- [DMD](../dmd) : This project is all about producing the design of an analog precision measuring device made for a CMI course.  
We used Proteus for the PCB design and determined the right values for our passive components and the best suited amp-op for the different task.
